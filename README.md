## Abstract

The escalating mental health crisis among university students poses a growing and urgent challenge. A major barrier intensifying this challenge is the process of seeking mental health support at universities. Many universities require students to complete extensive online forms to schedule an evaluation meeting before gaining access to immediate professional support. This project introduces a mental health booking platform tailored to address the issue. Developed using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, the platform focuses on creating a user-friendly experience with a calming colour scheme and a simple interface. The use of a relational database ensures seamless communication between users emphasizing simplicity and efficiency. The user interface for both students and therapists prioritizes usability, featuring straightforward options for booking and managing appointments. While ethical considerations prevented user surveys, the project closely adheres to exisisting research, creating a supportive digital environment for individuals grappling with mental health issues. In conclusion, The platform effectively addresses outlined research questions, and testing has verified the platform's functionality, ensuring it meets its core objectives and presents potential avenues for future enhancements. The platform's thoughtful design, functionality, and security measures position it as a valuable tool in university mental health solutions, contributing to the well-being of both students and therapists.![image](https://github.com/cbissue28/mentalHealthPlatform/assets/145153157/e1bcd4ae-5fef-4b3e-acc0-40174ce000fa)
